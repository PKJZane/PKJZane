### Hi everyone 👋, I am Michael

##### I am a core banking technical analyst now turned a data scientist. 
I am passionate about data particularly on how to generate insights and discover hidden pattern in data.
Every month for the next six months, I'll pick one ** Machine Learning Algorithms ** and solve problems with it. 
`September` is _Linear Regression Month_ and so I'm building *linear classifiers* all through the month. 
Follow me on this journey and you're more than welcome to provide inputs to my projects.
