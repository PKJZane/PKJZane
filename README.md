### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹, I am Michael

##### I am a core banking technical analyst now turned a data scientist. 
I am passionate about data particularly on how to generate insights and discover hidden pattern in data.
Every month for the next six months, I'll pick one **Machine Learning Algorithms** and solve problems with it. 

ðŸŒ±`SEPTEMBER` is _Linear Regression Month_ hurraay !!!. and so I'm building **linear classifiers** all through the month.
Follow me on this journey and you're more than welcome to provide inputs to my projects.
